# RcSwitchReceiver
433Mhz / 315 Mhz remote control receiver and decoder.

This work is based on experience with RcSwitch library https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch. The motivation for developing this library was to provide code that minimizes the interrupt handler runtime. This is achieved by doing many timing calculations already at compile time rather than at runtime by using template metaprogramming techniques. Another feature of this library is, that multiple instances of it can operate on different IO pins. However, this library does currently only receive, but not transmit remote control messages.

The development was done on an Arduino Due. Tests have shown that the working distance of several 433Mhz receiver modules strongly depend on the quality of the power supply. When the Arduino Due is supplied via USB port, the receiver module works properly when powered from the Arduino 5V pin. When the Arduino Due is supplied via the extra power connector, the Arduino 5V pin is is powered from an Arduino Due internal switching voltage regulator. A receiver module now powerd from the Arduino Due 5V pin, will drop the operating distance by at least 50% compared to the USB powering situation. So when the extra power connector is used for Arduino Due, I recommend suppying the receiver module separately by a linear Voltage regulator like an 7805, to achieve best operating distance.
